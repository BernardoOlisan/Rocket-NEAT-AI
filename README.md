# Rocket-NEAT-AI
Yeah, is not optimized. Rocket AI, using the NEAT algorithm for evolutionary process

## How to?
We have 2 `a.exe` files.
1. `a.exe` in the main folder.<br />
   It takes care of the evolution process, it trains the neural networks depending on where the exit point has been placed. When finished, it will modify the `.json` file that is in "tryouts"
2. `a.exe` in the tryout folder.<br />
   Once the training is finished, the tryouts folder will have all the necessary information to test the best rocket, you just have to run `a.exe` from tryouts
